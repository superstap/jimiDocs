# Actions

Actions within jimi are the building blocks of automation and enable jimi to do things when called by a trigger.

Actions needs to be connected from one another action or from a trigger.

To connect to an action select the starting object e.g. a trigger, then hold the "c" key while clicking on the object you want to connect to.

Double clicking on an object or link will open the options menu whereby you can define properties.

Logic links support True, False, Return code and/or logic. To use a return code or true/false just then them and press save. To use logic just type the logic string starting with if just as you would for another logic object as shown below. 

Actions work alot like programs on a computer you execute them and they return success or failure along with a return code which can be used to control what happens next in your jimiFlow
